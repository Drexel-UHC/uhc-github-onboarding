# Commit a change

- A **Commit** is saving a version of your project. Git tracks changes in between versions
- Commit often! Any meaningful progress should be committed. This helps you reset in case something goes run and makes managing changes easier.
- You can track changes and commit with GitHub desktop
- Lets make a secret change (sensitive data!)

# Pushing to GitHub

- You have updated your git project on your own computer (local)
- Now let us push it to GitHub
 
# Cloning an existing GitHub repo

- a repository is just a collection of files tracked by git
